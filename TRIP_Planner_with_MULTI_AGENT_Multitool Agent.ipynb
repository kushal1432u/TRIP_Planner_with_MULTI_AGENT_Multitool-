        "Problem Statement\n",
        "Anyone who has planned a trip knows that it's rarely a single, simple task. It's a complex, multi-stage project plagued by information overload, competing priorities, and fragmented processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A user might start by searching for flights, then jump to a dozen different hotel websites, then open 20 tabs to research activities, all while trying to keep a running tally of costs in their head or on a separate spreadsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is inefficient and stressful. Key information is scattered, context is lost, and what should be an exciting process becomes a chore. The core problem is that a human is forced to act as a \"project manager\" for a dozen different, disconnected tools (search engines, booking sites, spreadsheets). There is no single assistant that can understand the entire trip as one cohesive project, from initial idea to final budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Agents?\n",
        "This is precisely the kind of problem AI agents are built to solve. A simple chatbot can only answer one question at a time. An agent, or a team of agents, can manage an entire multi-step, long-running process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents are the right solution because they can:\n",
        "\n",
        "Decompose a Complex Problem: An agent system can break down the ambiguous goal of \"plan a trip\" into a logical sequence of tasks: clarify needs, research options, present findings, and track constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Tools: Agents are not just language models; they can act. By giving them tools like Google Search, they can access live, real-world data (like flight prices) instead of relying on outdated knowledge. With custom tools, they can perform stateful actions, like modifying a budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintain State & Context: Unlike a standard chatbot that forgets you, an agent system built with a session service can remember your destination, budget, and preferences throughout a long conversation, ensuring all its actions are aligned with your goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enable Specialization (Multi-Agent): The real world has specialists, and so should an AI system. By using a multi-agent \"team,\" we can assign one agent to be a friendly \"clarifier,\" another to be a data-driven \"researcher,\" and a third to be a polished \"compiler.\" This separation of concerns makes the entire system more reliable, robust, and effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Nomad\" Architecture\n",
        "I created Nomad, a multi-agent travel planner built on a sequential, \"assembly-line\" architecture. The user doesn't talk to one single, overwhelmed agent; they interact with a TravelManager that directs their request to a team of three specialists.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the overall architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "User → AgentRunner (Manages Session/Memory) --> SequentialAgent (The \"Manager\") --> [Agent 1: TripClarifier] → [Agent 2: ResearchExpert] → [Agent 3: ItineraryCompiler]\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent 1: TripClarifier (The \"Front Desk\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Job: Its only role is to be friendly and gather the four essential data points: Destination, Travel Dates, Interests, and Budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools: It has exclusive access to the set_budget tool. When the user provides a budget (e.g., \"$2000\"), this agent immediately calls the tool to set the \"master budget\" for the entire session.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent 2: ResearchExpert (The \"Silent Researcher\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Job: This agent never talks to the user. It works in the background, reading the plan from Agent 1. Its goal is to find 3-5 concrete options.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools: It has access to Google Search, add_cost, and get_remaining_budget. As it finds a hotel or flight, it checks the remaining budget and, if it's affordable, logs the expense with add_cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent 3: ItineraryCompiler (The \"Lead Planner\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Job: This agent takes the user's original request and the researcher's raw notes and synthesizes them into a single, polished, and friendly summary for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools: It has one tool, get_remaining_budget, which it calls at the very end to present the user with a final financial summary (Total Budget, Logged Costs, Remaining).\n",
        "\n",
        "Demo: How a User Experiences Nomad\n",
        "When you launch the chat interface, this is what a typical, successful journey looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 1: Clarification You start the chat, and the TripClarifier agent responds.\n",
        "\n",
        "User: \"Hi, I need to plan a trip.\" Nomad (Agent 1): \"That sounds exciting! I can help with that. Where are you planning on going?\" User: \"I'm thinking about going to Tokyo.\" Nomad (Agent 1): \"Great choice! When are you thinking of traveling?\" User: \"Maybe for a week in March. My budget is $3000.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "At this moment, you see a \"Tool Call\" in the interface. Agent 1 has just called set_budget(3000).\n",
        "\n",
        "Nomad (Agent 1): \"Got it! Budget set to $3000. And finally, what are your interests? Are you into food, museums, or adventure?\" User: \"I mostly just want to see the sights and eat amazing food.\" Nomad (Agent 1): \"Perfect. Thank you! Let me start researching that for you.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 2: Research (Silent) The chat pauses. The user sees a \"thinking\" indicator. Behind the scenes, the ResearchExpert is now active. It runs Google Searches like \"best hotels in Tokyo March\" and \"Tokyo food tours.\" It sees a hotel for \"$200/night\" and calls add_cost(\"Hotel\", 1400) (for 7 nights). It finds a food tour for $150 and calls add_cost(\"Food Tour\", 150).\n",
        "\n",
        "Phase 3: Compilation & Presentation After a few moments, the final agent joins the chat to present the complete plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nomad (Agent 3): \"Alright, I've put together a plan for your trip to Tokyo!\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on your interest in sights and food, here's a potential itinerary:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hotel: I found the 'Shinjuku Park Hotel' which has great reviews and is in a central location. (Logged: $1400)\n",
        "\n",
        "Activity: A 'Hidden Gems Food Tour' in the Shinjuku district. (Logged: $150)\n",
        "\n",
        "Sights: I'd also recommend visiting the Meiji Shrine and the Tsukiji Outer Market for great food.\n",

        "The Build: Technologies & Concepts\n",
        "This project was created entirely within a Kaggle Notebook using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Technology: Google ADK and the google.generativeai library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model: The core reasoning for all agents was powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key ADK Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "LlmAgent: The base class for our three specialist agents (TripClarifier, ResearchExpert, ItineraryCompiler). Their specific behaviors were defined entirely through their system prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "SequentialAgent: This was the \"manager\" agent that holds the other three agents in an ordered list, ensuring they execute one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "@tool Decorator: This was used to create our custom BudgetTracker class. By simply adding @tool above a Python function, the ADK automatically makes it available to the agent and handles the complex parts of function-calling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Search: A built-in tool provided by the ADK that gave our ResearchExpert access to real-time web data.\n",
        "\n",
        "InMemorySessionService & AgentRunner: These components worked together to manage the chat history. This is what allowed Agent 3 to see the entire conversation, from the user's first message to Agent 1's tool calls and Agent 2's research notes.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I Had More Time…\n",
        "This architecture is a strong foundation, but the true power of agents is in making them even more autonomous and intelligent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Give the Agent Long-Term Memory: Right now, the agent forgets you when you close the chat. I would add a \"personal notebook\" for the agent. This way, you could say, \"Remember, I'm vegetarian,\" and in all future chats, the agent would remember to only find vegetarian-friendly restaurants for you\n",
        "\n",
        "Make the Team Smarter: The current team is an \"assembly line\" that only moves forward. I would change this to a \"smarter\" loop. If the ResearchExpert finds that all the hotels are too expensive, it could \"loop\" back to the first agent to ask you, \"The hotels in that area are over budget. Would you like to increase your budget or change your dates?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Improve How Agents Talk: I would let the agents send short \"notes\" to each other instead of just passing the whole chat history. This would make them work more efficiently as a team. (Basically implement A2A)"
